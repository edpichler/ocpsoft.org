<p>We are pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://ocpsoft.org/rewrite/">Rewrite 2.0.5.Final</a>, which includes several bug fixes and enhancements.

<p>Rewrite is an OpenSource, Filter-based Servlets extension for Java – enabling creation of bookmark-able, pretty URLs. Rewrite solves the “RESTful URL” problem elegantly, including features such as: page-load actions, managed parameter parsing, seamless integration with CDI, Spring, and configuration-free compatibility with other web frameworks.

<h3>Bug fixes in 2.0.5.Final</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ocpsoft/rewrite/issues/109">Issue #109</a> - Context root is appended twice when using Navigate.to() class <br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ocpsoft/rewrite/issues/110">Issue #110</a> - View IDs with hard-coded query parameters were working in PrettyFaces 3, but no longer in PrettyFaces with Rewrite.

<p>Other critical issues fixed in prior releases have continued to be tested for security holes. If you use container-based security, and have not yet upgraded from Rewrite 2.0.3.Final, you should <b>Immediately</b> upgrade to 2.0.4 or 2.0.5.Final because of the following issue:

<h3>Critical issue in 2.0.0.Final -> 2.0.3.Final</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ocpsoft/rewrite/issues/111">Issue 111</a> - Container based security is circumvented when Rewrite is installed

<h3>Documentation improvements</h3>
<p>Additionally, we (mostly Christian) have put a good deal of work into the documentation and migration guide from Rewrite 1.x and PrettyFaces to Rewrite 2.x: You can find that guide here: http://ocpsoft.org/rewrite/docs/migration/prettyfaces3 - which is part of a larger effort to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17B03_n1OpsdEcqnmha0ch13xjz1pikiEagLgkMjIgFE/edit" target="_blank">improve our documentation</a> entirely. And of course, if you have any questions or concerns, please let us know on the <a href="http://ocpsoft.org/support/" target="_blank">forums</a>, or submit an issue to our <a href="https://github.com/ocpsoft/rewrite" target="_blank">issue tracker</a>.

<p>We hope you enjoy this latest release of Rewrite!<br/>
