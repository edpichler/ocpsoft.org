Often unknown, or heralded as confusing, regular expressions (regex) have defined the standard for powerful text manipulation and search. Without them, many of the applications we know today would not function. This two-part series explores the basics of regular expressions in Java, and provides tutorial examples in the hopes of spreading love for our pattern-matching friends. (Read <a href="http://ocpsoft.com/opensource/guide-to-regular-expressions-in-java-part-2/">part two</a>.)

<h2 class="toc">Part 1: What are Regular Expressions?</h2>
Regular expressions are a language of string patterns built in to most modern programming languages, including <a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Java 1.4 onward</a>; they can be used for: searching, extracting, and modifying text. This chapter will cover basic syntax and use.

Read <a href="http://ocpsoft.com/opensource/guide-to-regular-expressions-in-java-part-2/">part two</a> for more information on lookaheads, lookbehinds, and configuring the matching engine.

<h2 class="toc">1. Syntax</h2>
<a name="syntax"></a>Regular expressions, by definition, are string patterns that describe text. These descriptions can then be used in nearly infinite ways. The basic language constructs include character classes, quantifiers, and meta-characters.



<a name="charclasses"></a>
<h4 class="toc">1.1. Character Classes</h4>
Character classes are used to define the content of the pattern. E.g. what should the pattern look for?
<pre lang="perl">
.  	Dot, any character (may or may not match line terminators, read on)
\d  	A digit: [0-9]
\D  	A non-digit: [^0-9]
\s  	A whitespace character: [ \t\n\x0B\f\r]
\S  	A non-whitespace character: [^\s]
\w  	A word character: [a-zA-Z_0-9]
\W  	A non-word character: [^\w]
</pre>

However; notice that in Java, you will need to “double escape” these backslashes.

<pre lang="java">
String pattern = "\\d \\D \\W \\w \\S \\s";
</pre>



<a name="quantifiers"></a>
<h4 class="toc">1.2. Quantifiers</h4>
Quantifiers can be used to specify the number or length that part of a pattern should match or repeat. A quantifier will bind to the expression group to its immediate left.
<pre lang="perl">
*      Match 0 or more times
+      Match 1 or more times
?      Match 1 or 0 times
{n}    Match exactly n times
{n,}   Match at least n times
{n,m}  Match at least n but not more than m times
</pre>




<a name="metachars"></a>
<h4 class="toc">1.3. Meta-characters</h4>
Meta-characters are used to group, divide, and perform special operations in patterns.
<pre lang="perl">
\   	Escape the next meta-character (it becomes a normal/literal character)
^   	Match the beginning of the line
.   	Match any character (except newline)
$   	Match the end of the line (or before newline at the end)
|   	Alternation (‘or’ statement)
()  	Grouping
[]  	Custom character class
</pre>

<h2 class="toc">2. Examples</h2>
<a name="basic"></a>

<h4 class="toc">2.1. Basic Expressions</h4>

Every string is a regular expression. For example, the string, <code>“I lost my wallet”</code>, is a regular expression that will match the text, <code>“I lost my wallet”</code>, and will ignore everything else.

What if we want to be able to find more things that we lost? We can replace <code>wallet</code> with a character class expression that will match any word.

<pre lang="java">"I lost my \\w+"</pre>

As you can see, this pattern uses both a <b>character class</b> and a <b>quantifier</b>. <code>“\w”</code> says match a word character, and <code>“+”</code> says match one or more. So when combined, the pattern says “match one or more word characters.”

Now the pattern will match any word in place of “wallet”. E.g. <code>“I lost my sablefish”</code>, <code>“I lost my parrot”</code>, but it will not match <code>“I lost my: trooper”</code>, because as soon as the expression finds the <code>":"</code> character, which is not a word character, it will stop matching.

If we want the expression to be able to handle this situation, then we need to make a small change.

<pre lang="java">"I lost my:? \\w+"</pre>

Now the expression will allow an optional <code>":"</code> directly after the word ‘my’.

<a name="grouping"></a>
<h4 class="toc">2.2. Basic Grouping</h4>
An important feature of regular expressions is the ability to group sections of a pattern, and provide alternate matches.
<pre lang="perl">
|   	Alternation (‘or’ statement)
()  	Grouping
</pre>

These two meta-characters are core parts of flexible regular expressions. For instance, in the first example we lost our wallet. What if we knew exactly which types of objects we had lost, and we wanted to find those objects but nothing else?

We can use a group <code>()</code>, with an ‘or’ meta-character in order to specify a list of expressions to allow in our match.
<pre lang="java">"I lost my:? (wallet|car|cell phone|marbles)"</pre>

The new expression will now match the beginning of the string <code>“I lost my”</code>, an optional <code>":"</code>, and then any one of the expressions in the group, separated by alternators, <code>"|"</code>; any one of the following: ‘wallet’, ‘cell phone’, ‘car’, or our ‘marbles’ would be a match.

<pre lang="java">
"I lost my wallet"		matches
"I lost my wallets"		matches		the ‘s’ is not needed, is ignored
"I lost my: car"		matches
"I lost my- car"		doesn’t match	‘-‘ is not allowed in our pattern
"I lost my: cell"		doesn’t match	all of ‘cell phone’ is needed
"I lost my: cell phone"	matches
"I lost my cell phone"		matches
"I lost my marbles"		matches
</pre>

[info]<a href="http://ocpsoft.org/tutorials/regular-expressions/java-visual-regex-tester/#!;t=I%20lost%20my%20wallet%0AI%20lost%20my%20sablefish%0AI%20lost%20my%20parrot%0AI%20lost%20my%3A%20trooper%0AI%20lost%20my%3A%20car%0AI%20lost%20my%20cell%20phone&r=I%20lost%20my%3A%3F%20(wallet%7Ccar%7Ccell%20phone%7Cmarbles)&x=" title="Visual Java Regex Tester" target="_blank">Try this example online</a> with our Visual Java Regex Tester[/info]

As you can see, the combinations for matches quickly become very large. This is not the complete set, as there are several more phrases that would match our simple pattern. 

[error]
<p><strong>Quiz:</strong> Can you figure out all possible matches for this pattern? (<a href="javascript:" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#answer1">See the answers.</a>)

<pre lang="java">"I lost my:? (wallet|car|cell phone|marbles)"</pre>

<div id="answer1" class="collapse">
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This is a trick question! Because this regular expression is unlimited (has no beginning `^` and no ending `$` meta-characters to terminate the match,) the pattern we've created will actually match any string containing one of the results below. In short, nearly infinite possible matches; however, if we did want to limit our pattern to just these results, we could use add the required terminators to our pattern - like so:

<pre lang="java">"^I lost my:? (wallet|car|cell phone|marbles)$"</pre>

<pre lang="java">
"I lost my wallet"
"I lost my wallets"
"I lost my: wallet"
"I lost my: wallets"
"I lost my car"
"I lost my car"
"I lost my: car"
"I lost my: car"
"I lost my cell phone"
"I lost my cell phone"
"I lost my: cell phone"
"I lost my: cell phone"
"I lost my marbles"
"I lost my marbles"
"I lost my: marbles"
"I lost my: marbles"
</pre>
</div>
[/error]


<a name="matching"></a>
<h4 class="toc">2.3. Matching/Validating</h4>
Regular expressions make it possible to find all instances of text that match a certain pattern, and return a Boolean value if the pattern is found/not found. (This can be used to validate input such as phone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, web form input data, scrub data, and much more. Eg. If the pattern is found in a String, and the pattern matches a SSN, then the string is an SSN)

[snippit filename="Sample code"]
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ValidateDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		List<String> input = new ArrayList<String>();
		input.add("123-45-6789");
		input.add("9876-5-4321");
		input.add("987-65-4321 (attack)");
		input.add("987-65-4321 ");
		input.add("192-83-7465");


		for (String ssn : input) {
			if (ssn.matches("^(\\d{3}-?\\d{2}-?\\d{4})$")) {
				System.out.println("Found good SSN: " + ssn);
			}
		}
	}
}
[/snippit]

<strong>This produces the following output:</strong>

<blockquote><pre lang="text">Found good SSN: 123-45-6789</br>
Found good SSN: 192-83-7465</pre></blockquote>

[info]<a href="http://ocpsoft.org/tutorials/regular-expressions/java-visual-regex-tester/#!;t=123-45-6789%0A9876-5-4321%0A987-65-4321%20(attack)%0A987-65-4321%20%0A192-83-7465&r=(%3Fm)%5E(%5Cd%7B3%7D-%3F%5Cd%7B2%7D-%3F%5Cd%7B4%7D)%24&x=Found%20good%20SSN%3A%20%241" title="Visual Java Regex Tester" target="_blank">Try this example online</a> with our Visual Java Regex Tester [/info]

<h5>Dissecting the pattern:</h5>

<pre lang="java">
"^(\\d{3}-?\\d{2}-?\\d{4})$"
</pre>

<pre lang="perl">
^		match the beginning of the line
() 		group everything within the parenthesis as group 1
\d{n}		match n digits, where n is a number equal to or greater than zero
-?		optionally match a dash
$		match the end of the line
</pre>

<a name="capture"></a>
<h4 class="toc">2.4. Extracting/Capturing</h4>
Specific values can be selected out of a large complex body of text. These values can be used in the application.


[snippit filename="Sample code"]
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class ExtractDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String input = "I have a cat, but I like my dog better.";

		Pattern p = Pattern.compile("(mouse|cat|dog|wolf|bear|human)");
		Matcher m = p.matcher(input);

		List<String> animals = new ArrayList<String>();
		while (m.find()) {
			System.out.println("Found a " + m.group() + ".");
			animals.add(m.group());
		}
	}
}[/snippit]

<strong>This produces the following output:</strong>

<blockquote><pre lang="text">Found a cat.
Found a dog.</pre></blockquote>

[info]<a href="http://ocpsoft.org/tutorials/regular-expressions/java-visual-regex-tester/#!;t=I%20have%20a%20cat%2C%20but%20I%20like%20my%20dog%20better.&r=(mouse%7Ccat%7Cdog%7Cwolf%7Cbear%7Chuman)&x=" title="Visual Java Regex Tester" target="_blank">Try this example online</a> with our Visual Java Regex Tester[/info]

<h5>Dissecting the pattern:</h5>

<pre lang="java">"(mouse|cat|dog|wolf|bear|human)"</pre>

<pre lang="java">
()		group everything within the parenthesis as group 1
mouse		match the text ‘mouse’
|		alternation: match any one of the sections of this group
cat		match the text ‘cat’

//...and so on
</pre>





<a name="modify"></a>
<h4 class="toc">2.5. Modifying/Substitution</h4>
Values in text can be replaced with new values, for example, you could replace all instances of the word <code>‘clientId=’</code>, followed by<em> a number</em>, with a mask to hide the original text. (See below)

For sanitizing log files, URI strings and parameters, and form data, this can be a useful method of filtering sensitive information. A simple, reusable utility class can be used to encapsulate this into a more streamlined method.

[snippit filename="Sample code"]
import java.util.regex.*;

public class ReplaceDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String input = 
                  "User clientId=23421. Some more text clientId=33432. This clientNum=100";

		Pattern p = Pattern.compile("(clientId=)(\\d+)");
		Matcher m = p.matcher(input);

		StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer();
		while (m.find()) {
			System.out.println("Masking: " + m.group(2));
			m.appendReplacement(result, m.group(1) + "***masked***");
		}
		m.appendTail(result);
		System.out.println(result);
	}
}[/snippit]

<strong>This produces the following output:</strong>

<blockquote><pre lang="text">Masking: 23421
Masking: 33432
User clientId=***masked***. Some more text clientId=***masked***. This clientNum=100.</pre></blockquote>

[info]<a href="http://ocpsoft.org/tutorials/regular-expressions/java-visual-regex-tester/#!;t=User%20clientId%3D23421.%20Some%20more%20text%20clientId%3D33432.%20This%20clientNum%3D100&r=(clientId%3D)(%5Cd%2B)&x=***masked***" title="Visual Java Regex Tester" target="_blank">Try this example online</a> with our Visual Java Regex Tester[/info]

<h5>Dissecting the pattern:</h5>

<pre lang="java">
"(clientId=)(\\d+)"
</pre>
<pre lang="perl">
(clientId=) 	group everything within the parenthesis as group 1
clientId=	match the text ‘clientId=’
(\\d+)		group everything within the parenthesis as group 2
\\d+		match one or more digits
</pre>
<p class="warn alert"><span>Notice how groups begin numbering at 1, and increment by one for each new group. However; groups may contain groups, in which case the outer group begins at one, group two will be the next inner group. When referencing group 0, you will be given the entire chunk of text that matched the regex.</span></p>

<pre lang="java">
(  ( ) (  ( ) ( ))) ( )	//and so on
 1  2   3  4   5     6		//0 = everything the pattern matched
</pre>

<a name="conclude"></a>
<h2 class="toc">3. Conclusion & Next Steps</h2>
Wrapping up, regular expressions are not difficult to master - in fact, they are quite easy. My strategy, whenever building a new regular expression, is to start with the simplest, most general match possible. From there, I continuously add more and more complexity until I have matched, substituted, or inserted exactly what I need.


<p class="tip alert"><span>Don't be afraid to "express" yourself!
