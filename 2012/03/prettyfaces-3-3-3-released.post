PrettyFaces is an OpenSource Filter-based Servlets extension with enhanced support for JavaServer Faces – JSF 1.1, 1.2 and 2.0 – enabling creation of bookmark-able, pretty URLs. PrettyFaces solves the “RESTful URL” problem elegantly, including features such as: page-load actions, seamless integration with faces navigation, dynamic view-id assignment, managed parameter parsing, and configuration-free compatibility with other web frameworks.

[info] Get [[PrettyFaces | version 3.3.3]] of PrettyFaces now! See how simple URL-rewriting can be, with the power of open-source tools at your fingertips.[/info]

Thanks goes out to all of the developers who contributed to this release; a lot of work has been done, particularly in the realms of stability, performance, and inter-operability with other frameworks.
